# SVM-credit-card-detection

This code uses MATLAB to create a support vector machine model (SVM) to detect credit card frauds.

The code uses the data set which can be retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
Run the code with the .csv file placed in the same folder.
Important note is the graph displayed by the code does not provide a sufficcieint representation of the model, as it has only the first 2 features on the axis, the proper way to display it is using a hyperplane.

The model also measures the recall, F1-score, accuracy.
